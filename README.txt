Time Domain Coding Toolkit
==========================

The Time Domain Coding Toolkit contains Python implementations of
algorithms designed to reversibly convert finite-length, band-limited,
digitally sampled signals to and from a time-domain
representation. Sample code demonstrating the use of the
implementations is included.

==========================

The implementations in this package were written by Lev Givon,
currently at the Bionet Group [1] at Columbia University. Some parts
of the code are based (in part) on previous implementations written by
other members of the Bionet Group:

Eftychios Pnevmatikakis
Yevgeniy Slutskiy
Robert Turetsky
