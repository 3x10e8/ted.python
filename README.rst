Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox
==================================

Package Description
-------------------

The Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox contains Python implementations
of algorithms designed to reversibly convert digitally sampled signals
to and from a time-domain representation consisting of a series of
time intervals between fixed-amplitude spikes. Sample code
demonstrating the use of the implementations is included.
