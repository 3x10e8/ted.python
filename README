Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox
==================================

Package Description
-------------------

The Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox contains Python implementations
of algorithms designed to reversibly convert digitally sampled signals
to and from a time-domain representation consisting of a series of
time intervals between fixed-amplitude spikes. Sample code
demonstrating the use of the implementations is included.

Future releases of this package may be obtained from the Bionet
Group's online code repository [1]_.

Authors & Acknowledgments
--------------------------

The implementations in this package were written and packaged by Lev
Givon, currently at the Bionet Group at Columbia University. Some
parts of the code are based (in part) on previous implementations
written by the following members and alumni of the Bionet Group under
the supervision of Prof. Aurel A. Lazar [2]_:

* Eftychios Pnevmatikakis
* Yevgeniy Slutskiy
* Robert Turetsky

Special thanks are due to the following Bionet Group members for 
reviewing the code and providing useful suggestions:

* Robert Turetsky
* Yiyin Zhou
