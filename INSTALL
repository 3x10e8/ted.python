Installation Instructions
=========================

1. The Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox require several 
   prerequisites in order to be installed:

   Python 2.5          [http://www.python.org]
   Numpy 1.2.0         [http://numpy.scipy.org]
   Scipy 0.7.0         [http://www.scipy.org]
   PyTables 2.1.1      [http://www.pytables.org]
   Bionet Utils 0.01   [http://bionet.ee.columbia.edu/code]

   To run the demo code and generate plots, the following package 
   is also required:

   Matplotlib 0.98.5.3 [http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net]

   Earlier versions of the above packages may also work.

2. Install the utilities by running

   python setup.py install

3. Run the sample code in the demos/ subdirectory to make sure that
   everything is working properly:

   cd demos/
   python *.py

   These demos should generate a series of plots illustrating the
   use of the various time encoding and decoding algorithms.
