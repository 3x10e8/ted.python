Installation Instructions
=========================

Prerequisites
-------------

The Python implementation of the Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox
requires that several software packages be present in order to be
built and installed (older versions of these packages may work, but have not
been tested):

* `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ 2.5 or later.
* `Cython <http://www.cython.org>`_ 0.11.2 or later.
* `Numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ 1.2.0 or later.
* `Scipy <http://www.scipy.org>`_ 0.7.0 or later.
* `PyTables <http://www.pytables.org>`_ 2.0.0 or later.
* `Bionet Python Utilities <http://bionet.ee.columbia.edu/code>`_ 0.014 or later.

To run the demo code and generate plots, the following package 
is also required:

* `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net>`_ 0.98 or later.

To build the documentation, the following packages are also required:

* `Docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net>`_ 0.5 or later.
* `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_ 0.6.3 or later.

This software has been tested on Linux and MacOSX. Although not tested
on Windows, it should work on that platform given that all of the
above prerequisites are available for Windows.

Building and Installation
-------------------------

To build and install the toolbox, download and unpack the source 
release and run::

   python setup.py install

from within the main directory in the release. Sample code 
demonstrating how to use the toolbox is located in the
