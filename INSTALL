Installation Instructions
=========================

Prerequisites
-------------

The Bionet Python utilities require several software packages to be
present in order to be built and installed (newer versions of these
packages may also work). Some of the packages below are only required by 
some modules.

* `Python 2.5 <http://www.python.org>`_
* `Numpy 1.2.0 <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_
* `Scipy 0.7.0 <http://www.scipy.org`_
* `PyTables 2.1.1 <http://www.pytables.org>`_
* `Matplotlib 0.98 <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net>`_
* `OpenCV 2.1.0 <http://opencv.willowgarage.com/>`_
* `MEncoder 1.0 <http://www.mplayerhq.hu/>`_

This software has been tested on Linux and MacOSX. Although not tested
on Windows, it should work on that platform given that all of the
above prerequisites are available for Windows.

Building and Installation
-------------------------

Build and install the utilities by running::

   python setup.py install

Sample code demonstrating how to use some of the utilities is located
in the ``demos/`` subdirectory.
