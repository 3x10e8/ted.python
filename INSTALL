Installation Instructions
=========================

1. The Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox require several 
   prerequisites in order to be installed:

   Python 2.5          [http://www.python.org]
   Cython 0.11.2       [http://www.cython.org]
   Numpy 1.2.0         [http://numpy.scipy.org]
   Scipy 0.7.0         [http://www.scipy.org]
   PyTables 2.0.0      [http://www.pytables.org]
   Bionet Utils 0.01   [http://bionet.ee.columbia.edu/code]

   To run the demo code and generate plots, the following package 
   is also required:

   Matplotlib 0.98     [http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net]

2. Install the utilities by running

   python setup.py install

3. Run the sample code in the demos/ subdirectory to make sure that
   everything is working properly:

   cd demos/
   python *.py

   These demos should generate a series of plots illustrating the
   use of the various time encoding and decoding algorithms.
