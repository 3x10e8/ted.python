Installation Instructions
=========================

Prerequisites
-------------

The Python implementation of the Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox
requires that several software packages be present in order to be
built and installed (newer versions of these packages may also work).

* `Python 2.5 <http://www.python.org>`_
* `Cython 0.11.2 <http://www.cython.org>`_
* `Numpy 1.2.0 <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_
* `Scipy 0.7.0 <http://www.scipy.org>`_
* `PyTables 2.0.0 <http://www.pytables.org>`_
* `Bionet Python Utilities 0.014 <http://bionet.ee.columbia.edu/code>`_

To run the demo code and generate plots, the following package 
is also required:

* `Matplotlib 0.98 <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net>`_

This software has been tested on Linux and MacOSX. Although not tested
on Windows, it should work on that platform given that all of the
above prerequisites are available for Windows.

Building and Installation
-------------------------

Build and install the toolbox by running::

   python setup.py install

Sample code demonstrating how to use the toolbox is located in the
``demos/`` subdirectory.
